                                                 Basic Git Workflow Rules

                   1. Creating a New Branch

                        A new branch is created from the render_deploy branch.

                        The branch name should be informative and reflect the task's essence.

                   2. Commits

                       It is recommended to make no more than 5 commits per task.

                       Each commit should be as informative as possible and clearly describe what was done.

                   3. Pull Request (PR)

                      After completing a task, a Pull Request must be created.

                      A Pull Request is considered successful if it receives 2 approvals from developer and the PM.

                      An approved branch is merged into render_deploy.
